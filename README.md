# AiProject
CCIS level 6 AI course project

in this project we successfuly applied the Genetec Algorithm GA in our AI course.

project is an implementation of Genetic Algorithm for Multiprocessor Scheduling problem GAMSP.
you can find requirements & specifications in the given IEEE paper and project.pdf file.

note that teh projet is working fine but we had stressful times imlementing it that's why code seems to be little bit messy =D.

case u need help in uderstanding code feel free to contact us @abodamin0 or @iiD4x
